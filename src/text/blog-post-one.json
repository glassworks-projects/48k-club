    "So here it is: our shiny new website. We hope this will serve as a hub for all things 48k—to that end, we plan to regularly update not just the site but also this blog with what’s going on. We may also iterate on the design and use it as a testing ground for browser-ready ideas.",
    "We’ve been working on this site on-and-off (mostly off) for the better part of this year. It has been an opportunity to teach ourselves some new tools and expand our skill sets. It’s also a chance for us to take ownership of another facet of our practice—part of Do It All Our F—king Selves 2019. It has been a very rewarding and often annoying project, and we’re really excited to put it out into the wild today.",
    "More soon!"
